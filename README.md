# get_next_line
My diarrhea inducing get_next_line.

- Doesn't use libft ðŸ™‚
- Questionnably complies to 42born2code's norm (Actually it doesn't but norminette doesn't detect it)
- Reallocates the line buffer by adding BUFSIZE bytes each time, which is bad for very long lines.
- ft_printf.c is 42 lines long.
- Features comments!
